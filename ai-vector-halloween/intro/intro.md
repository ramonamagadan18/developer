## The Opening Scene

All Hallow's Eve of 1887 served as a cold start to England's Autumn. With no interest in the Halloween festivities, Holmes was catching up on this morning's newspaper and I was enjoying a quiet moment by the fire in our rooms at 221B Baker Street when I heard a commotion in the hallway. Suddenly, the door burst open with Inspector Lestrade exclaiming, "Holmes! The British Museum has been robbed! Professor Cavendish's original hydrogen research - stolen from the most secure vault in England!"

Holmes's eyes gleamed. "The legendary Pumpkin Papers."

"Pumpkin Papers? What in blazes are those?" I asked.

"Cavendish was rumored to have hidden his most revolutionary hydrogen research in - of all things - a decorative ceramic pumpkin to keep them from falling into the wrong hands," Holmes explained. "When he died in 1810, his estate donated his scientific papers and belongings to the British Museum for preservation. Most were catalogued and made public, but these particular notes - supposedly containing revolutionary insights into hydrogen combustion and potential weaponization - were deemed too dangerous. The museum locked them in their most secure vault. They're worth a fortune to any nation seeking new sources of energyâ€¦ or weaponry."

"The theft defies explanation, quite extraordinary" Lestrade continued. "The vault was locked, guards at every entrance. Yet at midnight, strange lights appeared, guards reported screams and apparitions, and by dawn - the papers had vanished."

"Suspects?" Holmes inquired.

"Three possibilities. Professor Moriarty's criminal network - they've been after scientific secrets. Foreign agents - German and French spies are in London. Or..." Lestrade paused. "Dr. Cornelius Pumpkin."

"The mad chemist and stage magician?" I exclaimed. "Why, I read in yesterdays post that he was expelled from the Royal Society?"

Holmes nodded. "And, Watson, he is none other than Henry Cavendish's great - nephew. Family connection gives him a motive."

"Watson, the game is afoot! The gleam in his eyes warning of a hunter in search of his prey."


## Solve the Mystery

Join Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this thrilling Halloween mystery! The famous decorative ceramic pumpkin has been stolen from the British Museum, and suspicions point to Dr. Pumpkin, the town's eccentric inventor. Use Oracle Autonomous AI Database's AI Vector Search to help Holmes uncover the truth behind this bizarre theft!

**What happened:** Top secret hydrogen fuel cell research was stolen from the British Museum vault!


**The suspects:** Three possibilities - Professor Moriarty's agents, foreign spies, or Dr. Pumpkin. But who is the real thief?

**The clues:** 
After examining the crime scene at the British Museum, Inspector Lestrade gathered what evidence he could find and returned to 221B Baker Street.

"Holmes, Watson," Lestrade began, pulling out his notebook, "we've collected witness reports and physical evidence from the scene. I need your help making sense of it all."

"Let me have a look at the clues," I said eagerly, reaching for the notes.

- `vector-space-diagram.png` - Diagram showing similar concepts clustering together in vector space

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Resolution**: Minimum 800x600 pixels, preferably 1200x900 or higher
- **Style**: Consistent Victorian/steampunk aesthetic to match the Sherlock Holmes theme
- **Colors**: Autumnal palette (oranges, browns, golds) mixed with Victorian colors (deep reds, navy blues)

## Sourcing Images

For a production workshop, you could:

1. **Commission illustrations** from artists specializing in Victorian/steampunk themes
2. **Use public domain images** of Sherlock Holmes (many illustrations are public domain)
3. **Create diagrams** using tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or Adobe Illustrator
4. **License stock images** from sites like Shutterstock or Getty Images (search for "Sherlock Holmes", "autumn harvest", "database diagrams")

## Alternative Approach

If sourcing images is not feasible, you could:

1. **Remove image references** and rely on text descriptions
2. **Use ASCII art** or text-based diagrams
3. **Create simple SVG diagrams** inline in the markdown

## Halloween Theme Consistency

Ensure all images maintain the Halloween/Sherlock Holmes crossover theme:
- Victorian London setting
- Mysterious, foggy atmosphere
- Autumn/Halloween elements (pumpkins, leaves, etc.)
- Detective/mystery solving motifs

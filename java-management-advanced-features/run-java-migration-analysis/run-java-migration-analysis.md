# Run Java Migration Analysis

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to run Java Migration Analysis on any Java application on your Fleet.

Estimated Time: 30 mins

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Java Migration Analysis Work Request using the Java Management Service console interface.
- View and monitor the status of Work Requests created using the Java Management Service console interface.
- View/download the generated Java Migration Analysis report.

### Prerequisites

- You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have received your sign-in credentials.
- You are using an Oracle Linux image or Windows OS on your Managed Instance for this workshop.
- Access to the cloud environment and resources configured in [Lab 1](?lab=set-up-and-enable-advanced-features-on-java-management-service).
- Java migration analysis is enabled on the fleet.
- Have a Java application compiled and run at least once with JDK 8 on your instance.

## Task 1: Submit Java Migration Analysis Work Request

1. First, open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**, and then click **Fleets** under **Java Management**. Select the fleet that you have configured in [Lab 1](?lab=set-up-and-enable-advanced-features-on-java-management-service).

2. In the **Fleet** details page switch to the **Managed instances** tab.

   You should see a list of Managed instances that are currently in your Fleet. Select the Managed instance you are interested in.

3. Switch to the **Applications** tab in the **Managed instances** details page. You should see a list of Java applications running in this managed instance.

   You could toggle the show/hide Java runtime installation paths to view or hide the Java runtime associated with each application.

4. Select the Java application you want to run with Java migration analysis. Click on **Actions** and select **Start Java migration analysis**.

   Java migration analysis can be executed on one or more applications at a time, and is applicable for deployed application on a server as well.

   Click on "Start Java migration analysis" option under Actions after selecting the applications to be analysed.

5. In the **Java migration analysis** panel, the source JDK is auto-populated to JDK 8, which is used for compiling and running this java application.

   Under the **Target JDK for migration analysis**, click the dropdown menu and select **JDK 17**.

   Click on **Apply the selected target JDK to all applications**. **JDK 17** will be applied as target JDK for the second application also.

   Leave package prefixes to filter as blank for now. If required, choose valid java package prefixes that need to be included or excluded in the analysis.

   Click **Submit** to start the Java migration analysis.

   > **Note:** You can also schedule Java migration analysis by selecting the **Schedule for later** and setting the schedule preference. Once submitted, you should see a new Scheduled task been created. To view/manage the scheduled task, refer to [Lab 12](?lab=view-and-manage-scheduled-tasks)
   > ![image of Java migration analysis schedule later](images/java-migration-analysis-schedule-later.png)

6. Click on the **Work requests** tab. You should see a list of the Work Requests that are currently in your Fleet.

   **Java migration analysis** that was started should be at the top of the list.

   ![image of work request](images/java-migration-analysis-work-request-started.png)

7. Wait for the work request to be processed. If the work request has been completed successfully, the status will change to **Completed without Errors**.

   ![image of work request completed](images/java-migration-analysis-work-request-started.png)

   > **Note:** It will take approximately 15 minutes for the request to be completed.

8. Once the work request status shows **Completed without Errors**, switch to the **Java migration analysis reports** tab.

   You should see a list of Java migration analysis reports that have been conducted in your Fleet. The latest **Java migration analysis** that has been completed should be displayed at the top of the list.

   The entire report can be downloaded for offline viewing by clicking on the three dots in the rightmost section of the row and selecting **Download report**. More information about the downloaded report will be explained under Task 2.

9. Click on the **Report name** of the **Java Migration Analysis report** to view the report. You should see the Report Summary Page indicating an assessment outcome of the migration effort.

   If there are no changes required, the assessment outcome should be **None**. Otherwise, it will be Minor or Major, depending on the percentage of mandatory changes required.

10. Select **Detailed Summary** to view the detailed breakdown of the type of the change, category, class count and diagnostic counts in the report.

    ![image of java migration analysis report](images/java-migration-analysis-result-final-1.png)

11. Select **Mandatory changes** to view the classes associated with this change type and the specific counts for removed API(s) as well as unsupported internal API(s).

    ![image of java migration analysis report](images/java-migration-analysis-result-final-2.png)

12. Click on any of the hyperlinks displaying the **Removed API(s)** or **Unsupported internal API(s)** count to view the details of all the selected APIs under the specific class such as location, line number and description with a link for more information.

    ![image of java migration analysis report](images/java-migration-analysis-result-final-3.png)

13. Click on the back icon next to the **Mandatory changes** at the top of the page to navigate back to the migration report.

14. Select **Recommended changes** to view the classes associated with this change type and the specific counts for terminally deprecated as well as deprecated API(s). You may click any of the hyperlinks displaying the **Terminally deprecated API(s)** or **Deprecated API(s)** count to view more details.

## Task 2: (Optional) Download Java Migration Analysis Report

1. To access the consolidated report and the raw results in multiple json files, navigate to the **Fleet** details page and scroll down till you see **Object storage**. Click the **View bucket details** name under **Object storage**.

   ![image of java migration analysis bucket object](images/fleet-bucket-link.png)

2. The **Java Migration Analysis** HTML report for the application is stored in the zip file: **JMS** > **JAVA_MIGRATION** > **fleet-ocid** > **managed-instance-ocid** > **workrequest-ocid** > **unique-id** > **application-name.zip**.

   The raw results that make up the zip file are available in json file format.

   ![image of java migration analysis bucket object](images/java-migration-analysis-download.png)

3. You can view the HTML report by opening the index.html file located in the folder, extracted from the zip file. A sample view of the report is shown below.

   ![image of java migration analysis html report](images/java-migration-analysis-html-report-1.png)

4. The report is divided into various sections. You can go to a section by hovering on the **Go To Section** at the top right of the page and select a specific section.

   The information displayed in each section is similar to what is shown on the Oracle Cloud user console.

# Introduction

## About Java Management Service Analyze Applications Features

Analyze Applications feature in Java Management Service (JMS) offers developers valuable insights into their applications. This feature allows you to analyze application data on-demand, without needing to set up a JMS Fleet.

Java Management Service (JMS) Fleets enable you to capture data from remote JVMs and perform analysis across multiple instances. This feature is explained in a separate workshop [Manage Java Runtimes, Applications and Managed Instances Inventory with Java Management Service](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=912).

The new Analyze Applications feature in Java Management Service (JMS) offers developers valuable insights into their applications. This feature allows you to analyze application data on-demand, without needing to set up a fleet.

There are currently two supported analyses:

* **Performance Tuning Analysis**: This feature analyzes JFR files from Java applications and recommend using a different set of command line parameters to improve the performance of the application.
* **Java Migration Analysis**: A comprehensive evaluation of the effort required to migrate an application from its current Java version to a newer one.

## About this Workshop

_Estimated Time:_ 30 minutes

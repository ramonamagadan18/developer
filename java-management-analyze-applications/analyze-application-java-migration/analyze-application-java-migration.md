# Create Java Migration Analysis

## Introduction

OCI Java Management Service (JMS) Java Migration Analysis evaluates application and runtime compatibility to plan safe, low-risk moves to newer JDKs (e.g., Oracle JDK 17/21). It flags deprecated/removed APIs, thirdâ€‘party library risks, and runtime behaviors, then generates prioritized remediation guidance and testing recommendations to streamline upgrades at scale.

Java Migration Analysis requires you to provide an artifact file (JAR, WAR, EAR, ZIP) containing the Java classes to be analyzed.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Launch Java Migration Analysis.
* View and interpret the results from the Java Migration Analysis.

### Prerequisites

* You have signed up for an account with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and have received your sign-in credentials.
* You have configured The Analyze Application feature using the **Setup Analyze Application on Java Management Service** [Lab](?lab=setup-analyze-applications-on-java-management-service).

## Task 1: Prepare a jar file to be analyzed

1. Get a jar to be analyzed. If you do not have one, you can navigate to Maven central and download a jar. For example, in this lab we will use [Log4j-core 2.6](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core/2.6).

## Task 2: Launch Java Migration Analysis

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**, and then click **Overview** under **Java Management**.

2. In the **Analyze Applications** section, **Applications** tab, click on **Create Analysis** button.

3. In the form, introduce a report name, choose **Java Migration analysis** as analysis type and click Next.

4. Select **Upload a file from local system** and drop or select the jar file generated in the [Task 1](#task1prepareajarfiletobeanalyzed). Click **Upload** to upload the file and then click Next.

## Task 3: Visualize the Java Migration Analysis Result

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**, and then click **Overview** under **Java Management**.
![image of console navigation to Java Management Service Overview](../common/images/console-navigate-jms.png)
2. In the **Analyze Applications** section, **Applications** tab, navigate to the **Analysis reports** section and click on the Analysis Result you generated in the previous Task.

3. Observe the Java Migration Report Information screen:

* **Header tabs**: _Migration report Information, Report summary, Detailed summary, Mandatory changes, Recommended changes, Archive summary, API View_.
* **Buttons**: _Download_ to download the report in HTML format and _View_ to visualize the Maven recommendations.

## Task 4: Download the Java Migration Analysis Result

1. In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu, click **Observability & Management**, and then click **Overview** under **Java Management**.
![image of console navigation to Java Management Service Overview](../common/images/console-navigate-jms.png)
2. In the **Analyze Applications** section, **Applications** tab, navigate to the **Analysis reports** section and click on the Analysis Result you generated in the previous Task.
